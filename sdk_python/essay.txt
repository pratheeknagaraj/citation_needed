Climate change has increasingly played a prominent role in political and economic decision making in large part due to the more substantiated evidence and effects. The market systems of the world have for the most part failed to contain the problems and escalation of climate change due to the heterogeneity of decisions and indecisions made at the local levels to this truly global problem. This issue poses even larger threats to society if more actions to contain the problem are undermined through political processes. Scientists and political leaders throughout most the world agree that actions against climate change should be effective immediately. The challenge, however, arises when questions such as the following are posed: What actions should be taken? Who should be implementing these actions? Who funds the actions? Who enforces climate change policies?
Source of the Market Failure
Climate change is the notable variation in the weather patterns and distribution across the world. This change has often been attributed to the increased or decreased activity of extreme weather events on Earth. Some unusual weather patterns attributed to climate change have been increasing hurricane and cyclone activity, melting of snow caps and glaciers, the polarization of precipitation patterns, and a general decrease in water resources in various locations throughout the world (IPCC 2007). Figure 1 depicts the overall trend of temperatures reinforcing the notion of global warming. Although there are a variety of causes that have been ascribed to climate change, the focus of sources of market failure concern anthropogenic causes wherein political decisions can be made by human actors that influence our climate. In terms of remediation strategies, however, non-anthropogenic causes can be addressed as well.
